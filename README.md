In this project I chose wine data and focused on the price and points parts.
As a coordinate system, I set points to control the position of the x-axis, while price controls the size, and the y-axis remains centered. 
So, I set the minimum and maximum values of price and point respectively.
Then map them separately to enlarge them to the required multiple in equal proportions.
Finally, I set the color of the circle to make it look like the color of wine, and set the transparency so that each data can be seen clearly.
